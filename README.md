This repository contains my practice notebooks from reading Hands-On Machine Learning by Auerelien Geron.
It's an amazing book which I highly recommend to anyone, especially if you are having trouble connecting theory to application. 

The second chapter alone has really helped put the different parts of a data science project into perspective.
From developing a target to deploying and monitoring a model in the first 100 pages, it's already answered many of my questions.
